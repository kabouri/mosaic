	abstract = {Bayesian network is the graphical model which can represent the stochastic dependency of the random variables via the acyclic directed graph. In this study, Bayesian network is applied for the up/down analysis of the stock index. The up/down rates of the daily stock indexes in three major markets are taken as the network nodes and then, the network is determined by K2 algorithm with the K2 metric as the prediction accuracy of the network. The present algorithm is applied for predicting the up/down analysis of the daily stock indeies in 2007 and the results are compared with the traditional algorithms; Psychological line and trend estimation, which are popular algorithms which are well-known by the traders. Their accuracy comparison shows that the average correction rate of the present algorithm is almost 60\%, which is almost equal or higher than them of the traditional algorithms such as the psychological line (50-59\%) and the trend estimation (50-52\%). Moreover, the vertical trading results reveal that the profit of the present algorithm is much greater than the others.},

However, volume Granger causes return volatility for only three cryptocurrencies (Litecoin, NEM, and Dash) when the volatility is low. However, this latter result only holds when squared returns are used as a proxy of volatility and not when GARCH volatility is employed.},

We first identify, through a set of diagnostic tests, five lagged predictive factors from a linear model. Using these factors, we predict on -month-ahead stock index returns with a nonparametric approach. We find that our nonparametric model can correctly predict about 74\% of stock index return signs. With various ex ante trading rules based on nonparametric predictions and transaction cost schedules, we then compare the performance of "managed" portfolios with that of the buy and hold portfolios. We fmd that the managed portfolios are mean-variance dominant over the buy-and-hold strategies when no or low transaction costs are assumed. When high transaction costs are assumed instead, the mean-variance dominance diminishes However,the Sharpe index of risk-adjusted portfolio performanceindicates that the managed portfolios significantly outperform the buy-and-hold strategies even for the high-transaction cost scenario. We show that the difference in performance between the managed portfolios and the buy-and-hold strategies can be partially explained by the January effect or the small firm effect. In sum, this paper demonstrates the merits of using a nonparametric approach for predicting stock returns and testing market efficiency.},

	abstract = {In recent years, machine learning has become prevalent in numerous tasks, including algorithmic trading. Stock market traders utilize machine learning models to predict the market's behavior and execute an investment strategy accordingly. However, machine learning models have been shown to be susceptible to input manipulations called adversarial examples. Despite this risk, the trading domain remains largely unexplored in the context of adversarial learning. In this study, we present a realistic scenario in which an attacker influences algorithmic trading systems by using adversarial learning techniques to manipulate the input data stream in real time. The attacker creates a universal perturbation that is agnostic to the target model and time of use, which, when added to the input stream, remains imperceptible. We evaluate our attack on a real-world market data stream and target three different trading algorithms. We show that when added to the input stream, our perturbation can fool the trading algorithms at future unseen data points, in both white-box and black-box settings. Finally, we present various mitigation methods and discuss their limitations, which stem from the algorithmic trading domain. We believe that these findings should serve as an alert to the finance community about the threats in this area and promote further research on the risks associated with using automated learning models in the trading domain.},

Drawing on documentary sources, 189 interviews with market participants, and fieldwork conducted at an algorithmic trading firm, we argue that automated markets are characterized by tight coupling and complex interactions, which render them prone to large-scale technological accidents, according to Perrow's normal accident theory. We suggest that the implementation of ideas from research into high-reliability organizations offers a way for trading firms to curb some of the technological risk associated with algorithmic trading. Paradoxically, however, certain systemic conditions in markets can allow individual firms' high-reliability practices to exacerbate market instability, rather than reduce it. We therefore conclude that in order to make automated markets more stable (and curb the impact of failures), it is important to both widely implement reliability-enhancing practices in trading firms and address the systemic risks that follow from the tight coupling and complex interactions of markets.},

Our comprehensive analysis for six cryptocurrencies shows that flexible semi-nonparametric approaches outperform risk mea­ sures of most crypto assets (particularly Bitcoin) and tend to provide the most conservative risk assessment. Furthermore, we propose the Median Shortfall as a robust-to-outliers and reliable risk measure for cryptocurrencies and discuss on the choice of the appropriate probability levels ac­ cording to the assumed distribution. The evidence supports that Median Shortfall at 98.31 \% and 98.51 \% confidence levels as accurate alternatives to Value-at-Risk at 99 \% and Expected Shortfall at 97.5 \%.},

	abstract = {Algorithmic trading allows investors to avoid emotional and irrational trading decisions and helps them make profits using modern computer technology. In recent years, reinforcement learning has yielded promising results for algorithmic trading. Two prominent challenges in algorithmic trading with reinforcement learning are (1) extracting robust features and (2) learning a profitable trading policy. Another challenge is that it was previously often assumed that both long and short positions are always possible in stock trading; however, taking a short position is risky or sometimes impossible in practice. We propose a practical algorithmic trading method, SIRL-Trader, which achieves good profit using only long positions. SIRL-Trader uses offline/online state representation learning (SRL) and imitative reinforcement learning. In offline SRL, we apply dimensionality reduction and clustering to extract robust features whereas, in online SRL, we co-train a regression model with a reinforcement learning model to provide accurate state information for decision-making. In imitative reinforcement learning, we incorporate a behavior cloning technique with the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm and apply multistep learning and dynamic delay to TD3. The experimental results show that SIRL-Trader yields higher profits and offers superior generalization ability compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

ATC is an online open-access journal that publishes novel works on algorithmic trading and its control methodologies. In this inaugural article, we discuss nine major challenges that contemporary Algo trading faces. There is nothing superstitiously magical about the number "nine," but so is any other one. Several of these challenges are at the strategy level, including for example, trading of illiquid securities or optimal portfolio execution. Others are more at the level of risk management and controls, such as on how to develop automated controls, testing and simulations. The editorial views could be inevitably personal and biased, but have been explored with the most innocent intention of contributing to this important field in modern financial services and technologies.},

	abstract = {This work aims to analyse the predictability of price movements of cryptocurrencies on both hourly and daily data observed from January 2017 to January 2021, using deep learning algorithms. For our experiments, we used three sets of features: technical, trading and social media indicators, considering a restricted model of only technical indicators and an unrestricted model with technical, trading and social media indicators. We verified whether the consideration of trading and social media indicators, along with the classic technical variables (such as price's returns), leads to a significative improvement in the prediction of cryptocurrencies price's changes. We conducted the study on the two highest cryptocurrencies in volume and value (at the time of the study): Bitcoin and Ethereum. We implemented four different machine learning algorithms typically used in time-series classification problems: Multi Layers Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and Attention Long Short Term Memory (ALSTM). We devised the experiments using the advanced bootstrap technique to consider the variance problem on test samples, which allowed us to evaluate a more reliable estimate of the model's performance. Furthermore, the Grid Search technique was used to find the best hyperparameters values for each implemented algorithm. The study shows that, based on the hourly frequency results, the unrestricted model outperforms the restricted one. The addition of the trading indicators to the classic technical indicators improves the accuracy of Bitcoin and Ethereum price's changes prediction, with an increase of accuracy from a range of 51-55\% for the restricted model, to 67-84\% for the unrestricted model.},

Focusing on financial markets, in which algorithmic securities trading founded on ML-based decision-making is gaining traction, I discuss the extent to which established sociological notions remain relevant or demand a reconsideration when applied to an ML context. I argue that ML systems have some capacity for agency and for engaging in forms of collective machine behaviour, in which ML systems interact with other machines. However, ML-based collective machine behaviour is irreducible to human decision-making and thereby challenges established sociological notions of financial markets (including that of embeddedness). I argue that such behaviour can nonetheless be analysed through an adaptation of sociological theories of interaction and collective behaviour.},

A successful stock buying/selling generally occurs near price trend turning point. Traditional technical analysis relies on some statistics (i.e. technical indicators) to predict turning point of the trend. However, these indicators can not guarantee the accuracy of prediction in chaotic domain. In this paper, we propose an intelligent ﬁnancial trading system through a new approach: learn trading strategy by probabilistic model from high-level representation of time series – turning points and technical indicators. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we utilize high-level representation (turning point and technical indicators). High-level representation has several advantages such as insensitive to noise and intuitive to human being. However, it is rarely used in past research. Technical indicator is the knowledge from professional investors, which can generally characterize the market. Second, by combining high-level representation with probabilistic model, the randomness and uncertainty of chaotic system is further reduced. In this way, we achieve great results (comprehensive experiments on S\&P500 components) in a chaotic domain in which the prediction is thought impossible in the past.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, cryptocurrencies have increasingly been discussed as alternatives to traditional fiat currencies. These digital currencies have garnered significant interest from investment banks and portfolio managers as a potential option to diversify the financial risk from investing in other assets. This interest has also extended to the general public who have seen cryptocurrencies as a way of making a quick profit. This paper provides a first insight into the applicability of high frequency momentum trading strategies for cryptocurrencies. We implemented two variations of a signal-based momentum trading strategy: (i) a time series method; (ii) a cross sectional method. These strategies were tested on a selection of seven of the largest cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization. The results show that there exists potential for the momentum strategy to be used successfully for cryptocurrency trading in a high frequency setting. A comparison with a passive portfolio strategy is proposed, which shows abnormal returns when compared with the momentum strategies. Furthermore, the robustness of our results are checked through the application of the momentum strategies other sample periods. We also compare the performances of the signal-based momentum strategies with returns-based versions of the strategies. It is shown that the signal-based strategy outperforms the returns-based strategy. However, there appears to be no single parameterization of the signal-based strategies that can generate the greatest cumulative return over all sample periods.},

In essence, a GBN is a model that combines several Bayesian networks (BNs) in such a manner that they may be active or inactive during queries to the model. We use objects called gates to combine BNs, and to activate and deactivate them when predefined logical statements are satisfied. In this paper we also present an algorithm for semi-automatic learning of GBNs. We use the algorithm to learn GBNs that output buy and sell decisions for use in algorithmic trading systems. We show how the learnt GBNs can substantially lower risk towards invested capital, while they at the same time generate similar or better rewards, compared to the benchmark investment strategy buy-and-hold. We also explore some differences and similarities between GBNs and other related formalisms.},

	abstract = {Academic research relies extensively on macroeconomic variables to forecast the U.S. equity risk premium, with relatively little attention paid to the technical indicators widely employed by practitioners. Our paper fills this gap by comparing the predictive ability of technical indicators with that of macroeconomic variables. Technical indicators display statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power, matching or exceeding that of macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, technical indicators and macroeconomic variables provide complementary information over the business cycle: technical indicators better detect the typical decline in the equity risk premium near business-cycle peaks, whereas macroeconomic variables more readily pick up the typical rise in the equity risk premium near cyclical troughs. Consistent with this behavior, we show that combining information from both technical indicators and macroeconomic variables significantly improves equity risk premium forecasts versus using either type of information alone. Overall, the substantial countercyclical fluctuations in the equity risk premium appear well captured by the combined information in technical indicators and macroeconomic variables.

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents proved to be to a force to be reckon with in many complex games like Chess and Go. We can look at the stock market historical price series and movements as a complex imperfect information environment in which we try to maximize return - profit and minimize risk. This paper reviews the progress made so far with deep reinforcement learning in the subdomain of AI in finance, more precisely, automated low-frequency quantitative stock trading. Many of the reviewed studies had only proof-of-concept ideals with experiments conducted in unrealistic settings and no real-time trading applications. For the majority of the works, despite all showing statistically significant improvements in performance compared to established baseline strategies, no decent profitability level was obtained. Furthermore, there is a lack of experimental testing in real-time, online trading platforms and a lack of meaningful comparisons between agents built on different types of DRL or human traders. We conclude that DRL in stock trading has showed huge applicability potential rivalling professional traders under strong assumptions, but the research is still in the very early stages of development.},

The nonparametric characteristics of our test control for misspecification due to nonlinearity and structural breaks, two features of our data that cover 19th December 2011 to 25th April 2016. The causality-in-quantiles test reveals that volume can predict returns – except in Bitcoin bear and bull market regimes. This result highlights the importance of modelling nonlinearity and accounting for the tail behaviour when analysing causal relationships between Bitcoin returns and trading volume.

Most existing academic or industrial Algos focus on how to "slice" a big parent order into smaller child orders over a given time horizon. Few models rigorously tackle the actual placement of these child orders. Instead, placement is mostly done with a combination of empirical signals and heuristic decision processes. A self-contained, realistic, and fully functional Child Order Placement (COP) model may never exist due to all the inherent complexities, e.g., fragmentation due to multiple venues, dynamics of limit order books, lit vs. dark liquidity, different trading sessions and rules. In this paper, we propose a reductionism COP model that focuses exclusively on the interplay between placing passive limit orders and sniping using aggressive takeout orders. The dynamic programming model assumes the form of a stochastic linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and allows closed-form solutions under the backward Bellman equations. Explored in detail are model assumptions and general settings, the choice of state and control variables and the cost functions, and the derivation of the closed-form solutions.},

This work brings an algorithmic trading approach to the Bitcoin market to exploit the variability in its price on a day-to-day basis through the classification of its direction. Building on previous work, in this paper, we utilise both features internal to the Bitcoin network and external features to inform the prediction of various machine learning models. As an empirical test of our models, we evaluate them using a real-world trading strategy on completely unseen data collected throughout the first quarter of 2021. Using only a binary predictor, at the end of our three-month trading period, our models showed an average profit of 86{\textbackslash}\%, matching the results of the more traditional buy-and-hold strategy. However, after incorporating a risk tolerance score into our trading strategy by utilising the model's prediction confidence scores, our models were 12.5{\textbackslash}\% more profitable than the simple buy-and-hold strategy. These results indicate the credible potential that machine learning models have in extracting profit from the Bitcoin market and act as a front-runner for further research into real-world Bitcoin trading.},

measures and generic price dynamics. Volume measures are the continuum analogies for discrete volume profiles commonly implemented in the execution industry. Execution then becomes an absolutely continuous measure over such a measure space, and its Radon–Nikodym derivative is commonly known as the participation of volume (PoV) function. The four impact cost components are all consistently built upon the PoV function. Some novel efforts are
made for these linear impact models by having market signals more properly expressed. For the opportunistic cost, we go beyond
the conventional Brownian-type motions. By working directly with the auto-covariances of the price dynamics, we remove the
Markovian restriction associated with Brownians and thus allow potential memory effects. In combination, the final execution
model becomes a constrained quadratic programming problem in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Important linear constraints
such as participation capping are all permissible. Uniqueness and existence of optimal solutions are established via the theory
of positive compact operators in Hilbert spaces. Several typical numerical examples explain both the behavior and versatility
of the model.},

In addition to the price-based technical rules popularly examined in the literature, we uniquely propose and statistically investigate technical rules that utilize information regarding (1) the order-ﬂow imbalance and (2) the order-book imbalance. Technical analysis using the imbalance-based trading rules is motivated by the evidence presented ﬁrst in this paper that short-term returns can be predicted from the information regarding the order-ﬂow and order-book imbalances for more than half of Nikkei 225-listed stocks. However, we demonstrate that no strategies, including limit order trading where trading signals are derived from the order-book imbalance, beat the buy-and-hold strategy within our sample. The results imply that past prices and demand/supply imbalances do not contribute to proﬁting in intraday trading and that non-execution and picking-off risks are too large for limit order trading to be proﬁtable in our sample.},

	abstract = {Foreign Exchange or Forex market is considered the largest trading market in the world. Trading in the Forex market, traders need to have a good trading strategy in order to make profits and be a successful trader. However, there are some factors that create limitations for many traders, such as, trading behaviors, emotions, and time. The development of Expert Advisor or EA allows automation of the analytical and trading processes under the MT4 platform. An EA with a good trading instruction can provide the ability to make profits and fulfill the limitations of human trades. In this research, we propose a novel EA that performs an automatically trade following the trading strategy. Our trading strategy is the combination between technical analysis including the ancient but powerful Japanese candlestick patterns and the modern technical indicators. The results of the evaluation by using the strategy tester function in the MT4 platform reveal that the proposed EA performs a good performance as it makes approximately 150 percent growth in a year. In addition, we perform an extensive experimentation in order to compare the performance of the proposed EA with the existing two EAs. The results show that the proposed EA have a better performance than both existing EAs testing in the same period of time and currency pairwise.},
